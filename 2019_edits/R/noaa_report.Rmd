# Gulf Scale


##  Summary Statistics

o   Total numbers tagged recaptured

o   Time at liberty

o   Distance travelled (water only)

o   Travel rates

```{r}
both %>% 
  group_by(tag_state) %>% 
  summarise(`Average Time at Liberty` = mean(time_at_large, na.rm = T),
            `Average Distance Travelled (by water*)` = mean())
```


##   Tagging State and Recapture State (Table or alluvial Plot)

 
# State Scale

##   Summary Statistics

o   Total numbers tagged recaptured

o   Time at liberty

o   Distance travelled (water only)

o   Travel rates


```{r}

```

##   Tagging State and Recapture State (Table or alluvial Plot)

```{r}

```
 

# Basin Scale

##   Summary Statistics

o   Total numbers tagged when (maybe a figure with calendar month and numbers tagged

o   Maps of tagging and recaptures

```{r}

```


##   Directions travelled (exclude crabs that travelled < 5km for this)

o   Raoâ€™s test for each

o   Crabs recaptured within home estuary

o   Crabs captured somewhere else

##  Travel rates (Maybe exclude crabs that have long times at liberty? Start with 1 month)

o   What patterns stand out: mean and variance etc. by season

```{r}

```

 
# Crabs outside of Estuaries

##   Map of just them

```{r}

```


##   Any recaptures

```{r}

```
